Exploring Java 8 features in a simple application.

This is a command-line application that generates files 
for some fictional framework. 

Commits are meant to show my train of thought. 
They are meant to be demonstrative and _not_ 
what I'd really do in production code.

## Side Effects

> In practice, applications need to have some side effects. Simon Peyton-Jones, 
> a major contributor to the functional programming language Haskell, 
> said the following: "In the end, any program must manipulate state. 
> A program that has no side effects whatsoever is a kind of black box. 
> All you can tell is that the box gets hotter."
> The key is to limit side effects, clearly identify them, 
> and avoid scattering them throughout the code.
